# stunning-octo-eureka

This project is for a script I use to automate updates on my Ubuntu Server.
It installs updates using apt-get, Runs a program to check if a restart is required, and sends a shutdown message to my TeamSpeak3 server using telnet.

#Credits
Some credit due to this (https://stackoverflow.com/a/7013379) post on stackoverflow for the telnet script.
